# A Skinny Naked Hugo (Work In Progress with Claude!)
*built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)* by - [KristopherRay.com](https://kristopherray.com)  

Start by deleting the contents of `/assets/sass/custom.scss` and if needed, delete `/posts` and `/logos/`

This "template" is cooked up as lightweight as possible with the latest Hugo and Bootstrap frameworks, just the way I like it, with my latest development philosophy of being as lean as possible.

*Packaged with:*
- [All the original <3 Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) [5.3.8] *customized and minified*
- [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/) [3.12.5] *for smooth animations*


**Required Local Dependancies:**
- [ >= Hugo v0.152.2 - Extended](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/)
